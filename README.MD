# Movie Recommendation System 
A movie recommendation system is an advanced algorithm designed to suggest films to users based on their preferences and viewing history. By analyzing user data such as previously watched movies, ratings, and viewing patterns, the system predicts and recommends movies that the user is likely to enjoy. On OTT (Over-The-Top) platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+, these systems play a crucial role in enhancing user experience by offering personalized content. They use techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods to deliver accurate and tailored movie suggestions, thereby increasing user engagement and satisfaction.mkdir images
